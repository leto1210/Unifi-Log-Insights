"""
AdGuard Home v0.107+ query log poller.

Architecture
------------
``AdGuardHomePoller`` runs as a single daemon thread started by ``main.py``
alongside the Pi-hole and UniFi pollers.  On each cycle it:

1. Snapshots the current config (host, credentials, cursor) into locals so a
   concurrent ``reload_config()`` call triggered by SIGUSR2 cannot corrupt an
   in-flight poll.
2. Pages through ``GET /control/querylog`` newest-to-oldest, accumulating
   entries until it crosses the stored cursor timestamp or exhausts all pages.
3. Filters to entries strictly newer than the cursor, resolves client names
   from the ``/control/clients`` cache, then inserts the batch and atomically
   advances the cursor in the same DB transaction.

Cursor semantics
----------------
The cursor stores the ISO-8601 timestamp of the *newest* entry seen so far.
On each poll, pages are fetched without ``older_than`` (newest first) and
walked backwards using the ``oldest`` field returned per page.  This ensures
new queries are never missed: the cursor only moves forward.

Thread safety
-------------
``reload_config()`` is called from the main thread's SIGUSR2 handler while
``_poll()`` runs in the poller thread.  All mutable state accessed by both
paths is guarded by snapshotting into poll-local variables at the top of
``_poll()`` and by detecting host changes mid-pagination.

    def _poll(self):
        """Fetch all query log entries newer than the stored cursor and insert them.

        Pagination
        ----------
        AdGuard's ``/control/querylog`` returns entries newest-first.  Each
        response includes an ``oldest`` field — the timestamp of the last
        (oldest) entry on that page — which we pass as ``older_than`` in the
        next request to walk backwards through history.  We stop when:

        * The API returns an empty page (no more data).
        * The page's oldest entry is at or before the cursor (we have caught up).
        * The page is shorter than ``_POLL_BATCH`` (last page in the log).
        * ``_MAX_POLL_PAGES`` is reached — safety cap to prevent infinite loops
          on very large backlogs; the cursor is **not** advanced so the next
          cycle retries from the same position without losing data.

        Concurrency safety
        ------------------
        Config is snapshotted into locals (``poll_host``, ``poll_headers``,
        ``cursor_str``/``cursor_dt``) before the loop starts.  Two guards
        protect against a concurrent ``reload_config()`` changing the host:

        1. **In-memory pre-poll check** — skips the cycle immediately if the
           DB host already differs from the snapshot (fast path).
        2. **In-loop check** — aborts without writing if ``self._host`` changes
           mid-pagination (detects SIGUSR2 reload during page fetches).
        3. **Transactional DB check** — ``insert_adguard_batch`` re-reads
           ``adguard_host`` *inside* the commit transaction; if it differs,
           ``AdGuardHostMismatch`` is raised and the transaction is rolled back,
           closing the TOCTOU window between the poll snapshot and the DB write.

        Timestamp handling
        ------------------
        ``_parse_ts`` returns ``(datetime, ns_int)`` tuples.  All ordering
        comparisons (pagination stop, dedup filter, cursor selection) use these
        tuples so entries differing only in sub-microsecond nanoseconds are
        ordered correctly.  The cursor is persisted as the original RFC3339Nano
        string to retain full precision across cycles.
